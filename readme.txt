This was a first pass at using the R package nflscrapR to create an expected points model. The ultimate goal was to create a win probability model and combine it with some other elements in 
a DVOA or ELO type system to attempt to gamble on NFL games.  This goal was cut short due to hiring of the only author.  

The author was hired by the Cleveland Browns in late 2017 to watch game film of college players.  To prevent a finalized version of the model from becoming IP of the Cleveland Browns, work on 
the model was discontinued before significant improvements could be made.
